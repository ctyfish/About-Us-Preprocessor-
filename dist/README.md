Hello! We are group 2 and our topic is "Share Without Thinking Resources Sharing Platform"

This is the README file of the homework "About us webpage preprocessor version"

To run the code we write in Pug and Sass, we need to:

First of all, install 'yarn' to compile the code

Secondly, open terminal and use the command to compile Pug file: yarn pug3 ./app/aboutus.pug -o ./dist/ -P

Thirdly, use the command to compile Sass file: yarn node-sass ./app/aboutus.sass -o ./dist/ -P

And you will see the HTML and CSS file converted from Pug and Sass file in the folder 'dist'

Last but not least, open the webpage with the the url: https://luffy.ee.ncku.edu.tw/~e24093100/preprocessor/dist/aboutus.html

You can see the webpage we write!

Thanks for reading!
